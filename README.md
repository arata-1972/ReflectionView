# ReflectionView

Have a complex rendering pipeline? Is the end-result of your pipeline a
single UIView? Do you need that view to present itself as two duplicate
views so the view will appear as a single image when viewed through a VR
headset?

You've found the most useful highly niche library for AR/VR yet. 

I've used this to:
- Replicate a react-native rendered app overlay for stereoscopic
  presentation
- Replicate an ARKit renderer and allow "stereoscopic on rotation"
  experiences.
